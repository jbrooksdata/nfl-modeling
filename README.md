### Figure 1: Field Goal Percentage Over Expectation

Based on [Tej Seth's nflfastR modeling tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4p8ZfYW5Oo), the figure below represents the relationship between each kicker's actual and expected field goal percentage from 2016 to 2021. Colored by their percentage over expectation and sized based on their number of field goal attempts, each point represents a kicker that has reached the threshold of 75 attempts since 2016. The code for Figure 1 can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jbrooksdata/nfl-modeling/blob/main/R/field%20goal%20pct%20expectation.R).
